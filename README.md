# GenericChallenge
Part of Udemy online course.

This is a simple project where I exercise and test my knowledge about Generics in Java. 
The point of this program is to take latitude and longitude coppied from Google Maps and assigned to specific locations. Example: Yellow Stone Park is at position: 44.4882, -110.5916. Rivers can have many points 
for example, Mississippi has: "47.2160, -95.2348", "29.1566, -89.2495", "35.1556, -90.0659".
Now I can separate Parks and Rivers.
